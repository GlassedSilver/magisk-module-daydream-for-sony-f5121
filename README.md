# Daydream Enabler for Sony Xperia X F5121 (v. 0.1)

I created this module to enable the android.software.vr.mode and
android.hardware.vr.high_performance features for my Xperia X which
may or **may not work on the Dual SIM model (F5122).**

Since this is a very low-level kind of file about the features provided
I doubt it though, I also don't have the Dual SIM model to compare.

I created this module using this how to, which you may feel free to use
yourself on your specific device:

That page also includes further steps needed to get into Daydream.
